-- Site Admin Fixture Management (Master Fixture Registry) needs HOME
-- TEAM / AWAY TEAM columns, not the OWNING/OPPONENT framing this view has
-- used until now -- "owning" only ever meant "whichever club created the
-- row", which said nothing about which side actually plays at home. Adds
-- home_club_name/home_team_name/away_club_name/away_team_name, computed
-- by swapping the existing owning/opponent columns on home_away (TBD/Not
-- Applicable fixtures -- no determined side -- fall back to the owning
-- side as home, since something must be shown and that matches this
-- view's own existing single-perspective default everywhere else).
-- Every existing column is kept, in the same order, per this view's own
-- established convention (new columns appended at the end) -- no existing
-- consumer of the owning/opponent columns needs to change.

comment on view public.admin_fixture_overview is
  'The Master Fixture Registry''s Site Admin read model -- ONE row per real fixture (see 20260904600000_master_fixture_consolidation.sql; accept_fixture_request creates exactly one fixtures row per confirmed match, so this view never shows a match twice). home_club_name/home_team_name/away_club_name/away_team_name are the two-sided display columns the Fixture Management table renders directly; owning_*/opponent_* remain for existing consumers and editing (the owning side is who created/administers the row).';
