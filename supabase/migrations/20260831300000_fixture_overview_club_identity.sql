-- Adds club-identity fields (ids + logo storage paths for both sides) to
-- admin_fixture_overview -- needed for the fixture detail header to show
-- club crests via the existing centralized ClubAvatar component, never a
-- second logo-fetching path. security_invoker unchanged, so this exposes
-- nothing the view didn't already expose via clubs/logo storage's own RLS.
--
-- Postgres requires CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW to keep every existing column
-- in its original position and only APPEND new ones at the end -- the new
-- logo_storage_path/opponent_club_id columns are appended after
-- message_count rather than inlined next to their related owning/opponent
-- fields, which is where they'd otherwise belong.
