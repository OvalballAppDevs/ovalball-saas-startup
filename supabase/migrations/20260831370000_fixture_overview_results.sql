-- Adds pitch/result fields to admin_fixture_overview -- Site Admin
-- Fixture Management uses the exact same canonical fixtures columns as
-- everywhere else, never a separate result store. Appended at the end of
-- the select list (Postgres requires CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW to keep every
-- existing column in its original position).
